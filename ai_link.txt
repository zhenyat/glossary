When you’re ready to continue, I can help with any of these:

Add a small FTS search CLI (scripts/search.rb) for quick querying
Optional triggers to auto-update updated_at on raw SQL edits
More seeds (Ruby/Python/Git, Unix, SQL examples), or sample bilingual lessons
A tiny web UI (Sinatra/Roda) to browse/search terms
Packaging (Makefile, CI checks) and a v0.1.0 release tag
Ping me anytime—I'll pick up right where we left off.
